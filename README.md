Developed a Weather Forecast App using React Native, WeatherAPI (www.weatherapi.com), and React Native Components with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive design. The app provides real-time weather updates, hourly and weekly forecasts, and location-based weather tracking. It features a clean UI with dynamic weather icons, temperature readings, and condition-based themes to enhance user experience. This project showcases expertise in API integration, state management, and responsive mobile UI design.
